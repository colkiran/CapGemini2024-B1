2. Modules and Packages

3. File Handling


Exceptions
----------
try:

    error prone code

except ValueError:

except ZeroDivisionError:

e


else:
 

finally:



Exception (Base Class)
    ValueError
    ZeroDivisionError
    KeyError


refer - Login Module = creates a log file


Modules and Packages
--------------------
Modules are same as libraries

any python file can be considered as a module because the extension of a module is also .py

Packages
--------
packages are same as folder or a directory where the modules are stored

packages are used to avoid naming conflict

Module1 - MysqlConnect (owner me)  => create a folder Kiran and store the 				       module inside it 

Module2 - MysqlConnect (owner IBM) => create a folder IBM and store the 				       module inside it


Consume a module
----------------
import Kiran.MysqlConnect
import IBM.MysqlConnect

without package name
import MysqlConnect


import mymodule
===============
1. mymodule.py file is converted to mymodule.cpython_311.pyc and will be stored in __pycache__ folder

2. python checks for the date and time of creation of .py vs .pyc files and it expects .pyc file have the latest date and time



Create a file with an extension .pth

from package import *

packages are compared with classes 
	classes have a constructor name __init__
	packages have a file __init__.py
